## GymPro: Exercise Navigator | [Link ->](https://satyam-gym.netlify.app)

Developed a comprehensive, AI-powered Health and Fitness Platform, combining a dynamic exercise encyclopaedia with a personalized plan generator. The core application is an innovative Gym Exercise website built with React, Material UI, and Redux, featuring robust search functionality that allows users to dynamically explore hundreds of exercises by body part, equipment, or name.
This platform is enhanced by an integrated AI Health & Fitness Coach, a micro-application built with Python, Streamlit, and the LangGraph framework. This new module leverages a sophisticated multi-agent workflow to generate holistic, personalized diet and workout plans based on user-specific data like age, weight, activity level, and fitness goals.
Key Features:
*	**AI-Powered Personalization**: Engineered a multi-agent system using LangGraph and Google's Gemini model to create customized, actionable health strategies.
*	**Full-Stack Integration**: Seamlessly connected the Python-based AI planner with the React front-end, providing a unified and intuitive user experience.
*	**Dynamic Exercise Discovery**: Implemented efficient search algorithms utilizing the Fetch API to retrieve and display exercise data, complete with embedded YouTube video previews.
*	**Modern Front-End Architecture**: Designed a responsive and performant single-page application (SPA) using React.js, managing complex state efficiently with Redux.
*	**Polished User Interface**: Utilized Material UI and responsive design principles to deliver a visually appealing and accessible experience across all devices.
